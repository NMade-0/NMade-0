# About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning the ropes of full stack app development
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with simple app ideas such as a simple puzzle game, or a daily planner
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love color combination of dark blue, purple, and black. I am still in college and am doing all of this in my free time. My favorite number is 2. I really hate ads (who doesn't).
- 🏷 I chose the name NMade because my initials are NM, and the things here under my name are made by me!!!
- Thanks for reading ;-;
